## Education

`1987-1991`
__BSEE Santa Clara University, Santa Clara, CA__


## Occupation

`2012 - Present`
__Tripwire, Inc.__, Portland, OR

- Software Architect
- Principle Developer

During my time at Tripwire I've built a Tripwire Labs program which incepted Tripwire's SaaS platform -
tripwire.io - upon which <a href="https://www.tripwire.com/products/tripwire-for-devops">Tripwire for
DevOps</a> and <a
href="https://www.tripwire.com/products/tripwire-expertops">Tripwire
ExpertOps</a> are built.

I was central to delivering a major overhaul to our agent collection stack using async messaging patterns
using ActiveMQ  and structured message definitions using Protobuf
encoding and I was a lead designer for <a
href="https://www.tripwire.com/products/tripwire-connect">Connect</a>,
our data processing and analytics platform using Kafka. As well I've introduced micro-service patterns and development, API creation via
REST and now GraphQL and deployment using Docker and Kubernetes.

To facilitate team _fast flow_ and consistency I've created and
maintained a team onboarding guide including a technology conventions
process to accomodate constant evolution.

I'm currently working with a launch team using <a href="https://kots.io/">Replicated KOTS</a> and Kubernetes to bring
tripwire.io features to industrial customers who require on-premise, enterprise style deployments.


`2004 - 2009`
__GemStone Inc.__, Beaverton, OR

- Architect

At Gemstone I designed and coded the transactional and
partitioned aspects of GemFire, a distributed key/value store.
Gemstone was sold to VMWare/Pivotal and is now in use today as <a
href="https://www.tripwire.com/products/tripwire-expertops">Pivol
Gemfire</a>


`1996 - 2004`
__NetGravity, Inc. -> DoubleClick Inc.__, San Mateo, CA

- Lead Engineer
- QA Architect

During my time an NetGravity and DoublecClick, I lead QA designs for
validating Netgravity AdManager and as part of the transition team
from NetGravity to Doubleclick grew my role to Lead Engineer focusing
on the AdClient technology stack integrating with a wide variety of
webservers such as Netscape and Apache.  Doubleclick's Ad technology
was aquired by Google in 2007 and is still in use today.
